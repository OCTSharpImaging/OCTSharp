# OCTSharp 
With the advance of hardware technology, imaging speed of
OCT has reached hundreds of kHz for spectral domain OCT and even breaks into MHz territory for swept source OCT. But
high-speed imaging demands massive computation power for high throughput data acquisition, processing, and
visualization(3, 4). Commercial OCT software provided with the OCT devices is convenient, but users usually cannot access
the source code to tailor the software for specific applications nor modify the hardware. For independent research groups, a
significant amount of effort is often spent on developing OCT software for real-time imaging, especially for clinical
applications. On the other hand, developing software that accommodates different hardware is often challenging. Virtual
processing plugin and OCT software development library in C++ have been explored (5, 6). However, developing or
maintaining C++ based OCT software is often challenging for non-professional software developers due to its complexity
of low-level memory management and the steep learning curve of C++ programming. In this abstract, OCTSharp is proposed
as open-source software that aims to significantly lower the programming complexity and development cycle for an
interactive, intuitive, and high-performance OCT developmental solution.
